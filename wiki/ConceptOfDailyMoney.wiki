The basic idea is money was transfered from one account to another, user record the detail for each transfer with his android phone. This application helps user to record detail, shows weekly/monthly/weekly report and mails csv through the android phone.

User can create multiple account with a name , initial value and account type, if type of an account is Asset, Liability or Other, it will has a initial value(money) for counting.

For each daily-money detail record, user have to fill following data in phone.
 * date
 * from account
 * to account
 * value (money)
 * note
</p>

= Rules of counting =
<p>
 * INCOME = Σ Detail.value(FROM is income)
 * EXPENSE = Σ Detail.value(TO is expense)
 * ASSET = Σ Account.initialValue(TYPE is asset) + Σ Detail.value(TO is asset) - Σ Detail.value(FROM is asset)
 * LIABILITY = Σ Account.initialValue(TYPE is liability) + Σ Detail.value(TO is liability) - Σ Detail.value(FROM is liability)
</p>

all archived Details are not editable and not included in counting.

the initial value of Asset type account will be updated after Details archived.
